# Submission

## Submit the target list
Once the validation is finished without errors, the Submit button becomes active and you can click it to submit your target list.

When uploading the file to our storage is finished, a message panel is shown to tell you about the successful submission.
The message contains `Upload ID` which is a 8-bit hex string unique to the submission.
Please keep `Upload ID` with you.

The `Upload ID` may be used for the following purposes.

- Inquiry to the observatory when you have any issues.
- Proposal preparation (the observatory will require `Upload ID` for PFS proposals at the time of the proposal submission.)

### Errors

When the Submission button is clicked, the validation process runs again. In a rare case, the validation fails and raises an error.
